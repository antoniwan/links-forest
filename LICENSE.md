## 🌿 LinkForest Licensing Intent

This project is not just open-source — it's open-soul.

You are _encouraged_ to:

- Fork it, remix it, and publish your own version
- Replace Linktree, Carrd, or any proprietary link page builder
- Share it freely, teach others to host it, or build niche themes on top of it

The only request is this:

> Don't resell or gatekeep this project behind paywalls without credit.  
> Make it better — and keep it free.

LinkForest is a gift for digital sovereignty, for the collective.  
Join the forest 🌲
